# CUDA-installation-on-Centos-6.10
I'd like to share my experience of CUDA installation on Centos 6.10

I've tried several times to install CUDA on my machine in which Centos 6.10 and NVIDIA TITAN X maxwell (GM200 GPU) are installed.

TITAN X maxwell has been supported since the version 349.77 so I started off with the oldest version but it couldn't generate linux kernel properly. My next shot on 375.66 and it worked.
